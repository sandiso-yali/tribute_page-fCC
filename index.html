          <p class="background1">
            Margaret Elaine Hamilton was born in August 17, 1936 in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield.
          </p>
          <p class="background2">
            The family later moved to Michigan, where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.
          </p>
          <p class="background3">
            She studied mathematics at the Univesity of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, where her mother had been a student. She earned a BA in mathematics and a minor in philosophy in 1958.
          </p>

          <p class="sage1">
            From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer, used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.
          </p>
          <p class="sage2"> She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements using simulators. 
            
          </p>
          <p class="sage3">
            SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense. It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.

          <p class="mit1">
            Hamilton learned of the Apollo project in 1965 and wanted to get involved due to it being "very exciting" as a Moon program. She joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed the Apollo Guidance Computer for the Apollo lunar exploration program.
          </p>
          <p class="mit2">
            Hamilton was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT and the first female programmer in the project, and later became Director of the Software Engineering Division. She was responsible for the team writing and testing all on board in flight software for the Apollo spacecraft's Command and Lunar Module and for the subsequent Skylab space station.
          </p>
          <p class="mit3">
            Her areas of expertise include: systems design and software development, enterprise and process modeling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modeling and development, automated life-cycle environments and more.
          </p>

          <h2 id="business">Business</h2>
          <p class="business1">
            In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program.
           </p>
           <p class="business2">
             They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT. It was successfully used in numerous government programs.
          </p>
          <p class="business3">
            Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984 and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment.
